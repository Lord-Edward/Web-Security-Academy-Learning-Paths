# Path Traversal

**(Q & Ans)** What is path traversal? <br>
Path traversal is **also known as directory traversal**. These vulnerabilities **enable an attacker** `to read arbitrary files on the server` that is running an application. This might include:
  1.  Application code and data.
  2.  Credentials for back-end systems.
  3.  Sensitive operating system files.</br>

In some cases, `an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server`, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.

Ex. `https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd`. This causes the application to read from the following file path: `/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd` assuming images are stored under `/var/www/images` folder.

The sequence `../` is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure. The three consecutive `../` sequences step up from `/var/www/images/` to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is: `/etc/passwd`.

**IMP**: On Windows, both `../` and `..\` **are valid directory traversal sequences**. The following is an example of an equivalent attack against a Windows-based server: `https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini`.

# Access Control

**(Q & Ans)** What is access control? <br>
Access control is the **application of constraints** `on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources`. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:
  1.  **Authentication** confirms that the `user is who they say they are`.
  2.  **Session management** identifies which `subsequent HTTP requests are being made` by that same user.
  3.  **Access control** determines whether the `user is allowed to carry out the action` that they are attempting to perform.</br>

## Vertical privilege escalation

1.  **If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not permitted to access** then this is `vertical privilege escalation`.
2.  **IMP**: For example, if a non-administrative user can gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts, then this is vertical privilege escalation.

## Unprotected functionality

1.  At its most basic, vertical privilege escalation arises where an application does not enforce any protection for sensitive functionality. For example, administrative functions might be linked from an administrator's welcome page but not from a user's welcome page. However, a user might be able to access the administrative functions by browsing to the relevant admin URL.
2.  For example, a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL: `https://insecure-website.com/admin`.
3.  **IMP**: This might be accessible by any user, not only administrative users who have a link to the functionality in their user interface.
4.  **IMP**: In some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the `robots.txt` file: `https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt`.
5.  Even if the URL isn't disclosed anywhere, an attacker may be able to use a wordlist to brute-force the location of the sensitive functionality.

6.  **IMP**: In some cases, sensitive functionality is concealed by giving it a less predictable URL. This is an example of so-called `"security by obscurity"`. However, hiding sensitive functionality does not provide effective access control because users might discover the obfuscated URL in a number of ways.
7.  Ex. Imagine an application that hosts administrative functions at the following URL: `https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556`.
8.  This might not be directly guessable by an attacker. However, the application might still leak the URL to users. The URL might be disclosed in JavaScript that constructs the user interface based on the user's role: Ex. as follows.
9.  ```
    <script>
    	var isAdmin = false;
    	if (isAdmin) {
    		...
    		var adminPanelTag = document.createElement('a');

                    # URL on next line
    		adminPanelTag.setAttribute('https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556');
    		adminPanelTag.innerText = 'Admin panel';
    		...
    	}
    </script>
    ```
10.  This script adds a link to the user's UI if they are an admin user. However, the script containing the URL is visible to all users regardless of their role.

## Parameter-based access control methods

1.  Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then **store this information in a user-controllable location**. This could be:
     -  **A hidden field.**
     -  **A cookie.**
     -  **A preset query string parameter.**
3.  The application makes access control decisions based on the submitted value. For example:
4.  ```
    https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true
    https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1
    ```
5.  **IMP**: This approach is insecure because a user can modify the value and access functionality they're not authorized to, such as administrative functions.

# Server-side vulnerabilities

## Path Traversal

**(Q & Ans)** What is path traversal? <br>
Path traversal is **also known as directory traversal**. These vulnerabilities **enable an attacker** `to read arbitrary files on the server` that is running an application. This might include:
  1.  Application code and data.
  2.  Credentials for back-end systems.
  3.  Sensitive operating system files.</br>

In some cases, `an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server`, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.

Ex. `https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd`. This causes the application to read from the following file path: `/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd` assuming images are stored under `/var/www/images` folder.

The sequence `../` is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure. The three consecutive `../` sequences step up from `/var/www/images/` to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is: `/etc/passwd`.

**IMP**: On Windows, both `../` and `..\` **are valid directory traversal sequences**. The following is an example of an equivalent attack against a Windows-based server: `https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini`.

# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

1.  This lab contains a SQL injection **vulnerability in the product category filter**. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`.
2.  To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

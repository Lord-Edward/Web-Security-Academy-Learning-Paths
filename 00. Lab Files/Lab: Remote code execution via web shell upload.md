# Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload

1.  This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.
2.  To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.
